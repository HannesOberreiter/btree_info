## :memo: Skills

I can speak and write **German** (mother tongue) and **English**. Due to my travels abroad on various organic farms I'm familiar with handy work and farm work overall. I also can do forestry work. With my office jobs I got experienced with **graphics and design** (InDesign, Illustrator etc.). I'm also a self-taught programmer using mainly **Javascript, R, MySQL**, less experienced but also know my way around **TypeScript and Python**. Thanks to some bigger projects I'm good and familiar with **Git** and typesetting of documents in **LaTeX**. In my study of **Biology** I also took **GIS**, **Statistics** and **Bioinformatics** courses, which where my favourites. In general I have a wide range of skills due to my broad interest in science, programming and agriculture.
