### General terms app.btree.at

The user relationship between you and b.tree takes effect through registration. As a user of b.tree you confirm that you have read, understood and accepted the general terms and conditions and the data protection declaration (<https://www.btree.at/en/data-privacy/>). Both sides are entitled to terminate the user relationship without observing a deadline and without giving reasons. We explicitly reserve the right to change, limit, suspend or terminate our service at any time and without prior notice. Our service may contain urls or links to external websites over which we have no control. We therefore assume no liability for this third-party content. The respective providers or operators of the pages are always responsible for the content of the pages linked by us. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. As soon as we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately. We endeavour to observe the property rights of third parties with regards to graphics, photos, images and texts. Should there be content on this platform that is not marked but protected by third-party copyright, the existence of such a property right was not recognizable at the time of use. In the event of such an unintentional infringement of copyright, the operator will immediately remove the relevant content from the offer after notification by the owner of the existing property right or provide the corresponding copyright notice. The service offered by b.tree is free of charge in the basic version until further notice. However, we reserve the right to convert this service into a paid service at any time. Claims for damages do not arise from this. All information and content on this platform is protected by copyright and may not be transmitted, converted, duplicated, transcribed or reproduced without our written consent. Should individual conditions of this agreement be ineffective or unenforceable or subsequently become ineffective or unenforceable, the remaining conditions shall remain unaffected. The ineffective or unenforceable condition shall be replaced by an effective and enforceable condition whose effect comes closest to the economic objective pursued with the ineffective or unenforceable condition. The same applies to possible regulation gaps.
