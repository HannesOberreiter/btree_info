### Support the app development

As premium member you support me to keep the database and homepage running. There are more features and functions already planned and I will try to improve the old ones. I want to say thanks to all user and hope you like my beekeeping software. I manage this homepage in my free time beneath my job and beekeeping and other hobbies.

My goal is to support beekeepers in their beekeeping with a simple but efficient beekeeping app.

All kind of feedback are more than welcome!

[^1]: If you were premium before you still can use all of your hives and apiaries! But you cannot add new ones.
