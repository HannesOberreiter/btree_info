### Multiple User / Beekeeper

If you want to add another user to your company, you can do this under [Options->Profile->Company](https://www.btree.at/app/profile/)to create new user or invite existing.

For users, there are three ranks:

- Admin
- User -> Cannot change ranks, cannot invite users and cannot delete the company
- Worker -> Can only work with the Quicktool and cannot delete tasks. Worker cannot work in the tables but see them. Worker can check tasks inside the calendar but not change the date (move them), also this rank has no access to the statistics.
- Read-Only -> This user can only look at the the data, but cannot make any changes. This rank can also not access the statistic pages.

Also there is the possibility to create a second company or to change the name of the existing. It cannot be deleted if other users are in the company or if it is your last company. (NB. If you want to delete the account go to [Options->Profile](https://www.btree.at/app/profile/) **Note, the data can not be recovered!**)

Premium Membership is per company and not per user, ie. you only need once Premium no matter how many users are active in your company. But for each company you need to buy Premium.

### NFC Tags

NFC tags are an easy way to quickly access hive details with your mobile phone (needs support for NFC). You can buy empty writeable NFC tags for example on Amazon. Then you need download a (free) application to write NFC (e.g. NFC Tools). Here you can read and write your NFC tags. The best way to use this is to directly access the hive details, which has the following URL logic https://www.btree.at/app/detail/hive/XXXX. The same is possible for apiary detail view https://www.btree.at/app/detail/apiary/XXXX.

After that simply stick the NFC tag on your hive and access quickly the details by swiping your mobile phone over the tag (only Android so far, iPhone wont read automatically NFC tags at the moment).
