### üêù Nature-loving | üñ•Ô∏è Technic Nerd | üå≥ Forestry Enthusiast | üçÉ Trying to making a Healthy Footprint

Hello there! I'm Hannes, and I'm thrilled to connect with like-minded professionals who share my love for nature and the incredible world of insects. As a biologist with a Bachelor of Science degree, I love to explore the wonders of the natural world and developed a deep appreciation for its complexity and beauty.

My academic journey took an exciting turn when I pursued an individual master's study on Computer Science in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the esteemed Institut for Biology, University of Graz. This unique blend of biology and technology allowed me to dive into the realm of data-driven solutions for biology related questions and challenges.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am also an avid beekeeper and and running a beekeeping software since 2014, which has been an immensely rewarding experience, enabling me to merge my passion for biology with my technical expertise.

During my spare time, you'll find me happily engaged in forestry work, as preserving our natural landscapes is something I hold dear to my heart. I'm also an enthusiastic iNaturalist, constantly contributing to biodiversity research and conservation efforts.

As a full-stack developer, I'm fortunate to have found a fulfilling career that supports my
insatiable thirst for knowledge. I am always on the lookout for exciting opportunities that bridge the gap between biology and computer science, seeking to leave a small, healthy footprint on this precious planet we call home.

Let's connect and explore how our shared interests in biology, technology, and sustainability can lead to meaningful collaborations and contribute to a brighter future. Feel free to reach out for networking, discussions, or potential projects. Together, let's make the world a better place for generations to come!
